# Enhanced-Encryption-Algorithms-Through-Parallelization

AES encryption and decryption algorithm is implemented using parallel code. AESâ€™s performance is successfully enhanced using MPI and the code was successfully parallelized using OpenMP. 
RC5 algorithm is implemented using both serial and parallel method. We implemented RC5 parallel code using OpenMP. We see that RC5 gives lesser execution time than AES ecryption decryption algorithm.
